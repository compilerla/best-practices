# Best Practices

> Guiding how Compiler builds software

## About

This is a guide for all development activity within Compiler. Whether delivering
the latest client project or working on an internal tool, we want to apply a
level of consistency to the work that we do. Here we outline a number of
technologies and processes to incorporate into your Compiler workflows.

This is a living guide. We expect to evolve the recommendations and technologies
as time goes on and new learnings are acquired.

This guide contains best practices, not absolutes. There are situations where
another tool or another approach entirely will make more sense. Apply these
guidelines judiciously, and reach out to the team if you have any questions.
