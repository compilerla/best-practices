> _Guiding how Compiler builds software_

## Introduction

This is a guide for all software development and related activity at Compiler.
Whether delivering the latest client project or working on an internal tool,
we want to apply a level of consistency to the work that we do. Here we outline
a number of technologies and processes to incorporate into your workflows at
Compiler.

!!! info "Heads up"

    This is a living guide. We expect to evolve the recommendations as time goes
    on and new learnings are acquired.

This guide contains best practices, not absolutes. There are situations where
another tool or another approach entirely will make more sense. Apply these
guidelines judiciously, and reach out to the team if you have any questions.
